 * USAGE OF THIS APIs
 * ------------------
 * From the board specific file, the kona_timer_modules_init will be called 
 * After that it will call the init function of timer.c and will pass the
 * following information in a platform structure
 * 1) Timer name to be used as system timer
 * 2) Frequency to be configured for system timer
 * 3) The channel of the timer to use as clock source (optional)
 * 4) The channel of the timer to use as clock event (optional)
 *
 * from the init function of timer.c kona_timer_modules_set_rate will be called
 * to set the system timer frequency. 
 * Then the appropriate channels would be setup for clock source/event by 
 * calling kona_timer_request()
