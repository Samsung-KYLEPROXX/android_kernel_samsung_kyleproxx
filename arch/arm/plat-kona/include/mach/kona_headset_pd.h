 * 1) Config 1
 *      a) GPIO for accessory insertion
 *      b) COMP1 for accessory type detection (on open cable).
 *      c) COMP2 for button press/removal detection.
 * 3) Config 2
 *      a) COMP1 for accessory insertion/removal.
 *      c) COMP2 for button press/removal detection.
 *
 * Backward compatibility - In the board file rhea_ray.c,
 * gpio_for_accessory_detection is not initialized and COMP1 IRQ is not
 * passed. In this case kona_headset.c will continue to use
 * GPIO for accessory detection and COMP2 for type detection and button press
 * detection.
 *
 * For Config 1 - From the board file gpio_for_accessory_detection should be
 * initialized to 1. COMP1 IRQ is passed through 'resources' structure.
 *
 * For Config 2 - Initialize gpio_for_accessory_detection to zero. COMP1 IRQ
 * is passed through 'resources' structure. The kona_headset_multi_button.c
 * implementation adapts itself to support accessory insertion/removal using
 * COMP1
