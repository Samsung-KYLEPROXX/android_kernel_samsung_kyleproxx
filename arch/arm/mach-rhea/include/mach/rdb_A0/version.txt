This file is the place holder that mentions what version of rdb was taken and
put here

Date		Version Info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
31/Oct/2011  	snap_2011-05-17 (Copied over from existing rdb directory)	
01/Nov/2011     Updated only the USB file brcm_rdb_hsotg_ctrl.h from snap_2011-10-28
01/Nov/2011     Updated the file brcm_rdb_dsi1.h with the B0 version snap_2011-10-28
		This is based on the inputs from Goran Gvozdenovic. 
		The following are the reasons provided by him to do this
		1) There are no functional differences in the DSI HW between A0 & B0
		2) B0 rdb defines bits previously left undefined, we might use them down the road
		3) A0 rdb file used so far, had a bug (wrong bit field
		   size definition) that in turn exposed bug in our driver with
		   introduction of B0 rdb ( thus changes in the driver )
		4) Although committed changes do not brake A0 DSI
		   functionality, in order not to complicate A0 support down the
		   road, A0 rdb should be identical to B0 version
		5) My recommendation is  to use B0.s DSI rdb for A0 as well
14/Feb/2012	Adding brcm_rdb_bmdm_rst_mgr_reg.h from snap_2012-02-07
