	  This enables support for accessing BCMNAND flash devices. 
	  These devices do not provide direct access to NAND cmd, 
	  data, and address registers, but instead use a high
	  level interface on top of a microcode implementation.

config MTD_BCMNAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentally due to device wear or something else.
