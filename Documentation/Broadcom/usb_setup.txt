==============

This document provides an overview of configuring usb device mode. 

2 USB Modes
===========================
The Broadcom kernel is compile to support RNDIS, ACM (2 instances), MSC, ADB.  
In the 2.6 kernel the usb modes can be selected from userspace by writing to 
the sysfs in /sys/class/usb_composite whene each mode has a folder and an 
enable subfile.  Each mode must be set and the order of setting determines the 
interface number supplied to the host PC.  This can affect the PC driver .inf 
files.  It is prone to error so we have created scripts to abstract the details 
away.  Also with the change to the 3.0 kernel the sysfs file structure has 
changed so it adds more knowledge just to switch modes.  The scripts handle 
both the 3.0 and 2.6 sysfs structures


Kernel 2.6 example
echo 1 > /sys/class/usb_composite/enabe

*** NOTE ***
Android boot_mode needs to run sh from busybox
/system/xbin/busybox sh /system/etc/atlog.sh rndis

3 atlog.sh script
===============================
This script selects usb modes and sets up the AT and Logging interface.  The 
bash environment on Android is restricted and shell scripted "if" logic doesn't 
work so the scripts need to be run busybox sh so we can use the "if [ xxx ]" 
logic.  This script uses the usbdev.sh to actually set the modes.  The atlog.sh 
just calls the usbdev.sh to set the mode and sets up the AT and Logging 
application to the right mode.

Example for RNDIS
sh /system/etc/atlog.sh rndis
or when in Android boot_mode
/system/xbin/busybox sh /system/etc/atlog.sh rndis

Example for ACM
sh /system/etc/atlog.sh acm
or when in Android boot_mode
/system/xbin/busybox sh /system/etc/atlog.sh acm

4 usb_tether.sh script
===============================
This script selects usb rndis mode and set up the network to MASQUERADE


5 usbdev.sh script
===============================
This script is main mode selecting script.  The scripts usb_tether.sh and 
atlog.sh use this script to select the mode.  It can detect 2.6 or 3.0 kernel 
and uses the appropriate commands.

Modes Supported
rndis 		- Selects RNDIS and sets up the network
acm 		- Selects dual instance ACM
acm_msc		- Selects dual instance ACM and MSC
adb			- Selects Android ADB mode
adb_msc		- Selects Android ADB mode and MSC
msc			- Selects MSC mode
none		- Turns off usb device mode
